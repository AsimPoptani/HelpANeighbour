## What it is

Help A Neighbour is an mobile app.

Have you stocked up too much or have you not got anything? Help a neighbour is an app designed to help people around you in a contact free way.

How it works, you post what you have in excess and post it.

People will then be interested in that item will either travel to that person's house.

The item will be placed outside where the person will pick it up.

Or the other way around.

Which also is promoting exercise and helping people out :)

## Technical stuff

The app is going to be made in React native and will connect to a Rest Api which is being headed up by XRMON

## Stages

### Prototyping Stage

We are looking at the community to help out here and help plan what the pages should look like :) . From this we then can plan the backend and the frontend. Hoping to get this done by the 23rd https://www.figma.com/file/mItqJCVwiDuh6U4DsYEqkC/Flow?node-id=1%3A9

## Development stage

Want to get involved? Contact me on discord @audittxl or email me asim@poptani.com having the subject "Help A Neighbour - here to help" with what you can help out with. We are looking to get this done in 2 to 3 days.

## Demo it

Going to demo it see what people think. We want as many comments as possible to help improve this app.

## Improve it

Going to go through the same cycle as above. :)

### Want to help

We need people to help in all stages agian contact me at @audittxl on discord or asim@poptani.com. I have no idea how to deal with large groups of devs so any help/experience would help.

Thank you all :)

## App Side

To help speed up development and UI we have made the following decisions:

- react-native-typography - We are using the material react-native-typography to make text look nice
- ramda - Using this for list manipulations
